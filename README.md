# UI Interview

### Context

HP needs a small application to list users that have access to a specific LLM model. You can use the code we sent as a starting point, changing it, or if you prefer, you can build this application from scratch. 

### Goals

- It can be a simple application with just one page.
- It must make an API request to list the users names and emails on the screen.
- It must have a button to switch between light and dark visualization modes.
- It must have at least one unit test.

### Notes
Use the fake people API to list the users: https://fake-json-api.mock.beeceptor.com/users
